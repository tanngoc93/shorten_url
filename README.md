#### Potential attack vectors

* API injection attacks
* DDoS Attack : there is no mechanism to restrict IPs from sending data continuously disrupting traffic
* Spam : don't implement API key, to protect from the spammers


#### What scalability issues

* We can implement a new API (API v2) without affecting the old users using API v1

#### How to install

* Please read `README-INSTALL.md`
